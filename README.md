# Alpine.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning repository for Alpine.js, a lightweight JavaScript framework for composing behavior directly in your HTML. This repository documents my journey with Alpine.js, including various projects, notes, and examples created while exploring the framework. The goal is to provide a valuable resource for myself and others learning Alpine.js.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with different folders, each dedicated to a unique tutorial or aspect of Alpine.js.

## Getting Started

To run any of the examples in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/najmul-islam/alpine.js.git
   ```

2. Check out the branch you want to explore:

   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

3. Open the HTML file in your preferred browser to see Alpine.js in action.
   *(No build process is required since Alpine.js works directly in the browser.)*

Each branch has its own README explaining the specific concepts and code.
